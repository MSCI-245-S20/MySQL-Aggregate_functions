The SQL `JOIN` keyword help SQL developers to answer questions about their data faster. 

Remember, that in order to create a SQL `JOIN`, two or more tables need to have a __key in common__. This key in common is part of SQL _constraints_ and is called `FOREIGN KEY`. 

`FOREIGN KEY`s are usually integer numbers that `REFERENCES` the `id`'s of another table column. 

__It is important to know__ that foreign keys need to have the same data type configuration in order to be valid reference keys. 

On the other hand, the SQL `UNIQUE KEY` allows no repeated values in the same table column fields.
