Now that you've reviewed the `e_store` database table structure, it's time to know how you are going to work with its data.

Imagine that the user wants to get from the product catalog: 

- The product with the lowest price
- The product with the highest price
- The most popular product
- The product with most stock
- The most recent product

While the user is viewing a single product, he/she may want to: 

- Get the average rating of the product

The user creates a wishlist with two or more products and he/she may want to: 

- Get the average rating of each product in the wishlist

Finally, after the user adds products to the shopping cart, he/she may want to: 

- Get the product count
- Get the total price
